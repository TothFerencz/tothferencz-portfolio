        I am a <span class="font-serif italic">full stack developer</span>  who builds clean, minimal, and scalable solutions. I love what I do â€“ both as a profession and as a hobby.

      <p class="text-base text-gray-700 font-prm font-prm-light   ">
        I enjoy solving problems through well-structured code, whether it's building modern frontends or robust backends. I believe in simplicity, clarity, and constant learning.

        This is my personal space where I share my projects and ideas. Sometimes I also write about engineering, architecture, and code quality.
